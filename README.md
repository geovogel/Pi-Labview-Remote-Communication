# Pi-Labview-Remote-Communication
The purpose of this project was to explore the use of ZMQ as a cross platform data transfer tool. The project is devided into two parts. The first part establishes the basic methodology to create an internet communication channel between a Raspberry Pi with a LINUX operation system and a desktop PC running Windows. A modified version of the Python "Hello World" program from the ZMQ documentation is adapted and used to work out the bugs. Notes on getting things to work can be found [here](DOC/ZeroMQ_Pi-PC_Client-Server_Python.pdf).
